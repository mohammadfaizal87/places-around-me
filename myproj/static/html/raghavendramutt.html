    Sri Raghavendra Mutt, a beacon of devotion dedicated to the revered Madhva saint, Guru Raghavendra Swamy.
     Believed to be the very house where the Saint resided during his visits to Srimushnam, the Mutt exudes a timeless charm.
      Its red-tiled roof and ochre walls echo the history of a thousand prayers whispered within its hallowed halls. Inside, a serene idol of Guru Raghavendra, adorned with vibrant garlands, presides over the devotees seeking his blessings. The air hums with the chants of hymns and the fragrance of incense, creating an atmosphere of tranquility and spiritual upliftment.
